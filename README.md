# Kostra

Kostra's a small(for now) project that intends to make common server tasks easier, by mashing up [Fabric](https://docs.fabfile.org) and [Flask AppBuilder](http://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/).

## Installation

Uh..maybe I should build it first..?

## FAQs

Still trying to figure that out.
